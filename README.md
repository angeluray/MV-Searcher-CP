# MV Searcher

MV Searcher is a JavaScript-based application styled by TailwindCSS and CSS3, that allows users to search for movies and shows by name through the search bar. Getting overall information, giving likes and dislikes, or making and seeing comments is possible due to the different API requests we make along the client-side interaction.
